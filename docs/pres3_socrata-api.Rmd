# API

API stands for _Application Programming Interface_.

It is both a translator and a messenger between two different programs.

Common Uses of APIs

<div class="indented2">
- call libraries written in C from R
- request data and have it returned in a known format
- access 'big' database and/or computing power (e.g., geocoding)
</div>

# Socrata API

DataSF.org is built upon [Socrata Open Data](https://dev.socrata.com/){target="_blank"}. 

The Socrata Open Data API (SODA) allows you to programmatically access a wealth of open data resources from governments, non-profits, and NGOs around the world.

Every datasets has its own URL or endpoint: For example,

[https://data.ct.gov/resource/y6p2-px98.json](https://data.ct.gov/resource/y6p2-px98.json){target="_blank"}

## Getting the API Endpoint (URL) for a Dataset

<img src="images/sodi_api_url_762x428.png" style="height:300;">

## Two types of API Endpoint

Human-readable URL:  
https://soda.demo.socrata.com/dataset/USGS-Earthquakes-for-2012-11-01-API/4334-bgaj

SoDA URL:  
http://soda.demo.socrata.com/resource/4334-bgaj.csv

## Import into R

Take note of the extension (csv, json. geojson, etc.). The RSocrata package has functions to import data from a SODA API endpoint.

```{r load_data, cache=TRUE}
library(RSocrata)
df <- read.socrata("http://soda.demo.socrata.com/resource/4334-bgaj.csv")
head(df)
```
 
**json** is another file format. It is very flexible but often is used to save a two-dimensional table. Let's load the [movie locations dataset](https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am){target="_blank"} from SFData.

```{r load_movies, cache=TRUE}
movie_loc_url <- "https://data.sfgov.org/resource/wwmu-gmzc.json"
movie_loc_df <- read.socrata(movie_loc_url, app_token="blM04kZ1D6AL2jNbK8o7VWiEj")
head(movie_loc_df)
```

Note two things:

- the URL is saved as a variable, and the variable is passed to the function
- a token is used

API Tokens

Many API use tokens or keys to regulate usage or require a subscription. A token is a little bit like a password.

SFData.org does not require tokens, but you can get throttled if too many people use it at once. Create a token at the [Developer Portal](http://datasf.org/opendata/developers){target="_blank"}. For today we can use the one above.

Importing polygon boundaries

[Neighborhood boundaries](https://data.sfgov.org/Geographic-Locations-and-Boundaries/Analysis-Neighborhoods/p5b7-5n3h){target="_blank"} can be imported as well. Look the SODA rest point:

https://data.sfgov.org/resource/xfcw-9evu.json

RSocrata does not currently know how to import a polygon layer. But you can get the geojson version of the data using the `sf` package. 

```{r load_nb, cache=TRUE}
library(sf)
nb_bnd = read_sf("https://data.sfgov.org/resource/xfcw-9evu.geojson")
plot(nb_bnd)
```
